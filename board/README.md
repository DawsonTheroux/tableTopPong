# Table Top Pong Board
Directory containing the source code for the pong board.

Currently, I am thinking about using a RaspberryPi Pico for this main board. The main drawback is I think I would probably just end up placing a whole development board on the PCB instead of just putting the RP2040. One advantage though is I get to have fun and impliment some thing via PIO.

## TODO
- Fill this directory.
